FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD in long run.
-Goals are about the results we want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
-What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend toomuch time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.

Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
