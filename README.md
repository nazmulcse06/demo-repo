FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD in long run.
-Goals are about the results we want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
-What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.

Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.

Behavior is a function of the Person in
their Environment, or B = f (P,E). You can also be the architect of
it.

Example:: 
During the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s, Dutch
researchers began to pay close attention to the country’s energy
usage. Others had the electrical meter
upstairs in the main hallway. Eventually, I took my own advice and redesigned my
environment.

Now the environment is digital era. If we can redesign it then we can be successful. 

Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and
make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:
If you want to remember to take your medication each night,
put your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom
counter.
If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your
guitar stand in the middle of the living room.
If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a
stack of stationery on your desk.
If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each
morning and place them in common locations around the
house.
